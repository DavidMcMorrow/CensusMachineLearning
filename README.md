# CensusMachineLearning

To run our assignment it is not neccessary to re-scrape the data we have it all included in the repo.

To run the assignment just run the file feature_creation.py and all the other files will execute.

Note: Cross validation can take a while to run so if you only would like the results just comment out the cross validation functions
